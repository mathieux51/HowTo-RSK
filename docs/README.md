# TL;DR 🇺🇸

This project was originally started with the goal of obtaining a technical diploma in Web development. The project's name is **HowTo**.
HowTo is a web platform that is meant to facilitate in the sharing of information. Let's imagine a person, a manager, that has to explain a very simple concept multiple times a day. The manager doesn't really want to create a tutorial for this because it's not worth the effort needed for such a casual explanation. However such multiple explanations on the part of the manager require time and energy that results in lost productivity. A situation that is very frustrating. HowTo can help the manager solve this with its fast and simple web application.

* First, you create a gif. This is easily done via a chrome plugin.
* Second, you upload the gif.
* Third, you share it or you can just leave so it will be available as a future ressource for anyone who needs it.

HowTo was built to be fast on mobile devices. It only takes few seconds to load and use the platform.

Coming soon is a new feature for uploading video via your phone's camera in order to have an optimised gif.
